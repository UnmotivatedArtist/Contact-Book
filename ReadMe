I used AI to create the CSV file, and to add names and numbers to two CSV files

I used AI in order to add comments to the code

I asked the AI to change the way that you selected what file you wannted to work with. Before, you had to type the filepath, but now you use a number to select the file option.
I used the Chat function in order to look at how some parts of the code work.
